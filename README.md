## Overview

[WhoIsAtMarsToday?](https://whoisatmarstoday.netlify.com) is a web app inspired by [How Many People Are In Space Right Now?](https://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/), listing the robots (and eventually humans) currently operational on the surface of, and on orbit around, Mars.

## Status
